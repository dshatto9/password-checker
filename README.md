# password-checker

The password checker works by inputting a password that you want to verify is safe to use. The program then outputs how many times your password has been hacked. The program is connected to the Have I Been Pwned API. I find this program is useful because it has security in mind. No one wants to use a password that's been leaked over a thousand times. A significant challenge I faced in this project was understanding hashes. Specifically SHA1.
